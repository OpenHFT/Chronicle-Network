== System Properties
Below, a number of relevant System Properties are listed.


NOTE: All boolean properties below are read using link:https://javadoc.io/static/net.openhft/chronicle-core/2.23ea13/net/openhft/chronicle/core/Jvm.html#getBoolean-java.lang.String-[net.openhft.chronicle.core.Jvm.getBoolean(java.lang.String)], and so are enabled if either `-Dflag` or `-Dflag=true` or `-Dflag=yes`

| Property Key | Default | Description | Java Variable Name (Type)
| chronicle.network.callOnMissedHeartbeatOnDisconnect |`false` | If enabled, calls onMissedHeartbeat when the connection is abruptly dropped | _CALL_MISSED_HEARTBEAT_ON_DISCONNECT_ (boolean)
| client.timeout | 500 | The overall timeout; number of milliseconds after which a client is timed out if they cannot connect to a server | _pausePeriodMs_ (int)
| connectionStrategy.pauseMillisBeforeReconnect | 500 | Allows control of a backoff strategy, and returns how long in milliseconds to pause before attempting reconnect | pauseMillisBeforeReconnect (long)
| connectionStrategy.pause.max.secs | 5 | Controls the maximum time the ConnectionStrategy.connect method is paused for | _maxPauseSec_ (long)
| connectionStrategy.pause.min.secs | 5 | Controls the minimum time the ConnectionStrategy.connect method is paused for | _minPauseSec_ (long)
| connectionStrategy.socketConnectionTimeoutMs | 1 | Amount of time waiting for a socket to open i.e. if the strategy is to retry every x seconds, each individual attempt will timeout after `connectionStrategy.socketConnectionTimeoutMS` and it will stop retrying after `client.timeout` | socketConnectionTimeoutMs (int)
| disable.tcp.nodelay | `false` | This disables link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm[Nagle's algorithm] for connections. When true, the connection will optimise for low packet latency at the cost of overall traffic | _DISABLE_TCP_NODELAY_ (boolean)
| tcp.client.buffer.size | 4 MiB | Sets the value for `SO_RCVBUF` | _tcpBufferSize_ (int)
| TcpEventHandler.targetWriteSize | 1024 | Determines the size of what is trying to be written to the ByteBuffer to check if ByteBuffer has capacity | _TARGET_WRITE_SIZE_ (int)
| tcp.event.monitor.secs | 10 | Sets how often the network stats listener will be notified of the network statistics, and the window over which they are measured. | _MONITOR_POLL_EVERY_SEC_ (int)
| tcp.failover.time | 2_000 MS | Amount of time before the TCP session timeout is triggered | _failoverTimeout_ (long)
| tcp.nbr.warning.nanos | 20_000_000L | Threshold before warning is triggered that non-blocking socket is being read to | _NBR_WARNING_NANOS_ (long)
| tcp.nbw.warning.nanos | 20_000_000L | Threshold before warning is triggered that non-blocking socket is being written to | _NBW_WARNING_NANOS_ (long)
